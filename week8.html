    <h1>Week 8 Project Problems</h1>
    
    <!-- List of items -->
    <ul>
        <li>making the hexagons form a shape after being separated</li>
        <li>choosing a shape</li>
        <li>experimenting with time</li>
        <li>making the colors overlap to create new colors</li>
      
    </ul>
    
    <p>I really wanted the sketch to be reminiscent of a stained glass window, so each shape would be various colors and they could overlap to form a new color.</p>
