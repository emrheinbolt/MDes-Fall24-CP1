            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>In the initial stages of my project, I explored various concepts and ideas. Initially I thought of creating a dinosaur standing by a tree, but after I created the tree I decided to change courses. I wanted to make a low-poly version of a photo I took of our chicken on a rocking chair. By adding a pumpkin, I gave the scene more of a Fall vibe.</p>

            <h2>Learning Approach</h2>
            <p>For this project, I had to learn new software and work with unfamiliar concepts. It was extremely difficult, and I had a challenging time navigating the software itself for awhile. After I became more familiar with the program, the lack of limits around what I could do was both fun and scary. Through the following tutorials I was able to build on the material given by our professor and learn how to create what I wanted:</p>
