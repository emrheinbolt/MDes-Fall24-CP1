                <h2>Interactive System with UI</h2>
                <p>Here is my project. I created a scene with a gecko represented by a black circle and flies buzzing around. By moving the slider to the right, you can give the gecko more flies to consume. As the gecko consumes the flies he grows bigger. The flies move around trying to aboid the gecko. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/emrheinbolt/sketches/ktsoUX4Oj" target="_blank">Week 10 Sketch</a> </p>
