                <h2>Representing Natural Forces</h2>
                <p>Here is my project. I created a scene with snow falling and a snowman. There are two sliders. One controls the rate of snow fall, and the second controls the wind speed. I initially thought about creating a temperature slider that effected the whole scene, so when it was higher than freezing, the scene would "melt" and when sliding back over to below freezing, snow would fall again. But I couldn't figure that out.<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/emrheinbolt/sketches/ktsoUX4Oj" target="_blank">Week 11 Sketch</a> </p>
